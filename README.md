# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

In this capstone, we will predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars; other providers charge up to 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a matter of fact, if we can predict whether the first stage will land, we can estimate the expense of a launch. This information can be used if another company wants to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This capstone project course will provide you with an understanding of what data scientists face when working with real datasets in the real world. You will take on the role of a Data Scientist for a startup.

# Problem Statement
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars; other providers charge up to 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a matter of fact, if you can accurately forecast the likelihood of the first stage rocket successfully landing, you can determine the cost of a launch. The competing startup that appointed you can make better-informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch using your Data Science insights and models.
# Project Objectives
1. To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately 
2. predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
3. Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.
